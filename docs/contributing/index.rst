Tips for Getting Your Pull Request Accepted
-------------------------------------------

#. Make sure all new features are tested and the tests pass.
#. Bug fixes must include a test case demonstrating the error that it fixes.
#. Open an issue first and seek advice for your change before submitting a pull request. Large features which have never been discussed are unlikely to be accepted.
