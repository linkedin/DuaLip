Demo
=================

Through the following examples, we show detailed demos on how to use this solver. We showcase two common use cases by
focusing on two example problems. For each problem we answer the following:

#. How to translate the problem mathematically to get :math:`A,b,c` and :math:`\mathcal{C}_i`.
#. How to formulate the training data.
#. How to execute the solver.
#. How to read the results and do inference.

The two specific examples are:
