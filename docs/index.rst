DuaLip: Dual Decomposition based Linear Program Solver Documentation
====================================================================

DuaLip is an extreme-scale Linear Program (LP) solver based on Apache Spark. It solves structured LP problems of the following form arising from web-applications:

.. math::
  \begin{array}{ll}
    \mbox{minimize} & c^T x \\
    \mbox{subject to} & Ax \leq b \\
    &x_i \in \mathcal{C}_i \;\;\text{for all} ~i\in \{1,2,...,I\}
  \end{array}

where :math:`x = (x_1, ..., x_I)` is the full vector of optimization variables, :math:`x_i` is the vector of optimization
variables associated with one :math:`i`, and :math:`A,b,c` and :math:`C_i` are user-supplied data.

It is a distributed solver that solves a perturbation of the LP problem at scale via gradient-based algorithms on the smooth dual of the perturbed LP with computational guarantees. DuaLip can easily scale to problems in trillions of variables.

Features
------------------

.. glossary::

#. Extreme Scale
    Dualip is specifically developed to tackle problems arising in web-applications that usually have hundreds of millions of users and millions of items, pushing the number of optimization variables in the trillions range (if not more). It uses a dual decomposition technique to be able to scale to such large problems. For details see the :ref:`solution <probsolution>` and for a wide range of applications see `Ramanath et. al. (2021) <https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05277>`_ and `Basu et. al (2020) <http://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/basu20a/basu20a.pdf>`_.

#. Efficient
    Although we follow first-order gradient methods to solve the problem, we implement several highly efficient algorithms for each of the component steps. See the :ref:`solver <solver>` for more details. This allows us to scale up 20x over a naive implementation. Please see `Ramanath et. al. (2021) <https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05277>`_ for a comparative study.

#. Modular Design
    In our implementation, any problem can be formulated through a highly modular approach.

		- **solver**: We begin by choosing a first-order optimization solver. We currently support `Proximal Gradient Ascent <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal_gradient_method>`_, `Accelerated Gradient Ascent <https://www.ceremade.dauphine.fr/~carlier/FISTA>`_, and `LBFGS-B <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited-memory_BFGS>`_
		- **projectionType**: We implement several very efficient projection algorithms to allow for a wide class of constraint sets :math:`\mathcal{C}_i`. For a list of supported constraints sets see :ref:`here <constraints>`.

    Each of these components is highly flexible and can be easily customized to add new solvers, or new types of projections for different constraints sets :math:`\mathcal{C}_i`. New formulations can also be added by appropriately stitching together these different components.

#. Infeasibility Detection
    We have incorporated simple checks on infeasibility (see Appendix D of `our paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05277>`_). This helps the end user to appropriately tweak the problem space.

#. Extensive Logging
    We have added extensive logging to help users understand whether the solver has converged to a good approximate solution. For more details, please see :ref:`here <logging>`.

#. Warm start
    We allow the user to input an initial estimate of the dual solution, if she is familiar with the problem space. This allows for very efficient solving of the overall problem.

#. Autotuning
    We have implemented an autotuning mechanism, that automatically selects and adaptively changes the smoothness parameter to achieve faster convergence. In most situations, users may not know how to choose a value for this parameter and we alleviate this issue completely.

Usage
------------------
Building the Library
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
It is recommended to use Scala 2.11.8 and Spark 2.3.0. To build, run the following:

.. code:: bash

  ./gradlew build

This will produce a JAR file in the :code:`./dualip/build/libs/` directory.
If you want to use the library with Spark 2.4 (and the Scala 2.11.8 default), you can specify this when running the build command.

.. code:: bash

  ./gradlew build -PsparkVersion=2.4.3

Tests typically run with the :code:`test` task. If you want to force-run all tests, you can use:

.. code:: bash

  ./gradlew cleanTest test --no-build-cache

Using the JAR File
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Depending on the mode of usage, the built JAR can be deployed as part of an offline data pipeline, depended 
upon to build jobs using its APIs, or added to the classpath of a Spark Jupyter notebook or a Spark Shell instance. For example:

.. code:: bash

  $SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-shell --jars target/dualip_2.11.jar
