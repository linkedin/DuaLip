# DuaLip: Dual Decomposition based Linear Program Solver
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-BSD%202--Clause-orange.svg)](LICENSE)

DuaLip is an **extreme-scale** Linear Program (LP) solver based on Apache Spark. It solves structured LP 
problems of the following form arising from web-applications:

```
minimize        c'x
subject to      Ax <= b
                x_i in C_i  for i in 1,2,...,I
```

where `x = (x_1, ..., x_I)` is the full vector of optimization variables, `x_i` is the vector of optimization
variables associated with one `i`, and `A`,`b`,`c` and `C_i` are 
user-supplied data.  
 
It is a distributed solver that solves a perturbation of the LP problem at scale 
via gradient-based algorithms on the smooth dual of the perturbed LP with 
computational guarantees. Dualip can easily scale to problems in trillions of variables.

## Features

### Extreme Scale
DuaLip is specifically developed to tackle problems arising in web applications that usually have hundreds of millions of users
and millions of items, pushing the number of optimization variables into the trillions range (if not more). It uses a dual 
decomposition technique to be able to scale to such large problems. For details and a wide range of applications, see [Ramanath et. al. (2021)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.05277.pdf) and [Basu et. al. (2020)](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/basu20a/basu20a.pdf).

### Efficient
Although we follow first-order gradient methods to solve the problem, we implement several highly efficient algorithms 
for each of the component steps. This allows us to scale up 20x over a naive 
implementation. Please see [Ramanath et. al. (2021)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.05277.pdf) for a comparative study.

### Modular Design
In our implementation, any problem can be formulated through a highly modular approach.
* `solver`: We begin by choosing a first-order optimization solver. We currently support [Proximal Gradient Ascent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal_gradient_method), 
[Accelerated Gradient Ascent](https://www.ceremade.dauphine.fr/~carlier/FISTA), and [LBFGS-B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited-memory_BFGS).
* `projectionType`: We implement several very efficient projection algorithms to allow for the wide class of constraint
sets `C_i`. 

Each of these components is highly flexible and can be easily customized to add new solvers, or new types of projections
for different constraints sets `C_i`. New formulations can also be added by appropriately stitching together these different components.
 

### Detects Infeasibility
We have incorporated simple checks on infeasibility (see Appendix D of [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05277)). This helps the end user to appropriately tweak their problem space.    

### Extensive Logging
We have added extensive logging to help users understand whether the solver has converged to a good approximate solution. 

### Warm start
We allow the user to input an initial estimate of the dual solution, if she is familiar with the problem space. This 
allows for very efficient solving of the overall problem.

## Usage

### Building the Library
It is recommended to use Scala 2.11.8 and Spark 2.3.0. To build, run the following:
```bash
./gradlew build
```
This will produce a JAR file in the ``./dualip/build/libs/`` directory.

If you want to use the library with Spark 2.4, you can specify this when running the build command.
```bash
./gradlew build -PsparkVersion=2.4.3
```
Tests typically run with the `test` task. If you want to force-run all tests, you can use:
```bash
./gradlew cleanTest test --no-build-cache
```

### Using the JAR File
Depending on the mode of usage, the built JAR can be deployed as part of an offline data pipeline, depended 
upon to build jobs using its APIs, or added to the classpath of a Spark Jupyter notebook or a Spark Shell instance. For
example:
```bash
$SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-shell --jars target/dualip_2.11.jar
```

### Usage Examples
For detailed example usage, please see the [Getting Started](https://linkedin.github.io/DuaLip/get_started/index.html) wiki.
